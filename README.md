# NPM Package Development Starter Kit

ðŸš€ **NPM Library Development Kit** is a starter template for building and publishing robust, type-safe NPM packages using TypeScript. Whether you're creating a utility library, a CLI tool, or a backend service, this kit provides everything you need to get started quickly and efficiently.

---

## Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Write type-safe code with full TypeScript integration.
- **Dual Module Support**: Compatible with both **CommonJS** and **ES Modules**.
- **Tsup Bundling**: Uses [`tsup`](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) for fast and efficient transpilation and bundling of TypeScript code. `tsup` simplifies the build process with zero configuration and supports features like tree-shaking and type declarations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v10.8 or higher)

### Set Up and Link This Library to Your Project

1. Clone the `library-development-kit repository`.
2. Run `npm install` (Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system).
3. Execute `npm run watch` or `npm run build`.
4. After completing step 3, an output directory `(dist)` will be created. Navigate inside the `dist` folder and run `npm link`.
5. Navigate to your `TypeScript` or `JavaScript` project and run `npm link library-development-kit`.
6. Run your project.

### Build the library

- Run the `npm run build` command to generate the final bundled version, which will be stored in the `dist` folder.
